# Stress Level Prediction

This project aims to predict an individual's stress level using machine learning techniques based on various behavioral features. The dataset includes metrics such as heart rate, sleep quality, activity levels, and other relevant factors. The model applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, and multiple regression/classification algorithms to accurately estimate stress levels.

An interactive interface is provided (e.g., via Streamlit) to allow users to input their data and receive real-time stress level predictions. The project also includes model evaluation and comparison to select the most effective algorithm for this task.

The goal is to provide a practical tool for early stress detection and management support.

Note: This repository is a demonstration project intended for educational purposes and portfolio showcase. It is not designed for production use.
